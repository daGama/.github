## Who we are 🗼

daGama is a consumer app for Real World Locations (RWL) that leverages blockchain and AI technology to create a map with trusted recommendations. 🎡🏰

## daGama mission 🏖

Our mission is to rebuild trust in online reviews by forging a global community where participants share their discoveries and quality recommendations, earning rewards in DaGama tokens. 🌋🏜

daGama creates a user-generated map with recommendations from a worldwide community, ensuring the authenticity of every location and recommendation with our multi-level anti-fake system.

## daGama story 🥀

Hey, I'm Gabriel Hattar, and I'll share with you where the idea for our project came from. 🧗🏻‍♂️🚣🏻‍♀️

My friend and I are avid travelers. Once, we booked a house in Cyprus through a well-known accommodation service. The reviews praised it as a quiet spot just 100 meters from a sandy beach, with nearby restaurants and shops, and it had almost a 5-star rating. But in reality, there was a busy highway next door, a massive construction site, and instead of a sandy beach, a dirty wasteland. The restaurants were far away, requiring a car rental costing around €500–700 a week. We also tried a seafood restaurant with great reviews from another popular review service. People raved about the fresh seafood from a famous chef. Despite the 40-minute wait hinting at an amazing experience, when our dishes arrived, they were just cheap, battered fish. At that moment, we realized we'd been duped by misleading reviews. 🏄‍♂️🏄‍♀️

After a disappointing experience, I asked a local guy to mark places with delicious food on a map. From then on, everything was tasty and affordable. This inspired me to create an app where you can quickly find great spots based on genuine reviews and recommendations from people who share your tastes and preferences. 🧘‍♀️🏂

July 19. Anti-fake system: We have prepared the initial implementation of our anti-fake system, which consists of dozens of modules. It evaluates content, its creator and reviewer according to various criteria in order to filter quality content as accurately as possible. The system uses a unique fingerprint to prevent rating spoofing through multiple reviews, comments and likes, without interfering with the main functions of the app.
