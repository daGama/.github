## Who we are 🗼

daGama is a post-to-earn travel-tech eccosystem that compiles recommendations from a global DAO-community of discoverers. We simplify and improve user experience through personalized AI selections of the best places. 🎡🏰

## daGama mission 🏖

Our mission is to forge a global community where participants share their discoveries and quality recommendations, earning rewards in DaGama tokens. Businesses will distinguish themselves not through marketing alone but by the quality of their service and products. 🌋🏜

Together, we are shaping a people's map of recommendations, enabling each participant to travel like a local and become a discoverer of exceptional places. 🗽🎎

## daGama story 🥀

The name of the application "daGama" carries historical significance, as it is associated with the great 15th-century explorer Vasco da Gama. The choice of this name symbolizes the spirit of discovery and adventure, akin to how Vasco da Gama charted new maritime routes and horizons. 🧗🏻‍♂️🚣🏻‍♀️

The project's idea emerged from a real "pain point." When discovering a new city, one desires to visit interesting local spots preferred by the residents and enjoy high-quality services favored by locals. However, mainstream travel guides and services often highlight touristy places, and businesses sometimes prioritize marketing over the quality of their services. This led to the concept of creating a "community map" of intriguing locations and quality services. 🏄‍♂️🏄‍♀️

Only one challenge remained: how to incentivize people to share their unique discoveries. The solution was found in the DEFI concept of Post-to-Earn. Community users recommend points of interest, and DAO consciousness evaluates their quality. The most active members of the community receive rewards in DaGama tokens. 🧘‍♀️🏂

## Product Updates 🚀

19 July. Anti-fake system: We have prepared the initial implementation of our anti-fake system, which consists of dozens of modules. It evaluates content, its creator and reviewer according to various criteria in order to filter quality content as accurately as possible. The system uses a unique fingerprint to prevent rating spoofing through multiple reviews, comments and likes, without interfering with the main functions of the app.

## Release notes 📖

25 July. This release includes mail registration, profile errors display, Dubai 59 points added, map loading acceleration, swipe feed updates, layout flaw redesign, anti-fake system, and image resize.
